# FrameID
Android app for real-time face recognition.
# Frame ID â€“ Face Recognition App  

Frame ID is an **Android app** built with **Java and OpenCV** that performs real-time **face detection and recognition**.  
It captures images, extracts face features, and matches them using **cosine similarity / raw pixel comparison** (no ML libraries like TensorFlow Lite).

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸ“¸ Capture faces using the device camera  
- ðŸŽ­ Automatic face detection using Haar Cascades  
- âš¡ Real-time recognition with cosine similarity  
- ðŸ’¾ Store and manage face data locally  
- ðŸŒ“ Simple UI with camera switch, capture, and recognition buttons  

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java (Android)  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV (Haar Cascade)  
- **Approach:** Manual recognition (no deep learning model, uses raw image comparison)  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `MainActivity.java` â†’ handles camera preview, capture, recognition  
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` â†’ Haar Cascade model for detection  
- `CapturedImages/` â†’ stored training images  
- `face_data.json` â†’ processed face vectors & labels  

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. Capture face images (auto-saves ~100 samples).  
2. Convert â†’ preprocess & extract faces.  
3. Recognition â†’ compares live frame with stored faces using cosine similarity.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- This app is for **learning and experimentation** with computer vision.  
- Not production-ready, no cloud or online storage.
